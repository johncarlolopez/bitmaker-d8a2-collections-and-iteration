# 02 - Programming Fundamentals: Collections and Iteration
## Wednesday, Dec 13th

### Exercise 0
___
#### Creating Arrays and Hashes

Save each of the following arrays and hashes into variables. You will use them throughout the assignment.

Eg. ``` fav_colours = ``` ...

Create an array for each item below that contains the given information:

* your favourite colours
* the age of you and your siblings/cousins/friends
* flip a coin 5 times and record whether or not the result was 'heads'
* your three favourite performing artists
* your favourite colours again (this time as symbols instead of strings)

Create a hash for each item below that contains the given information:

* three words and their definitions
* your favourite movie names and their year of creation
* three cities of the world and their population
* the names of your siblings/cousins/friends and their ages

After you've done that you should run your code to make sure there aren't any syntax errors. You should get in the habit of running your code after each step in order to catch any mistakes as soon as they're introduced.


Exercise 1
___
1. Print out the array of coin flips.
2. Print out the first element of the array of your favourite colours.
3. Output the sorted version of the array of your friends and family members' ages.
4. Add a new baby (0 years old) to the array of your family's ages.
5. Using the hash of movie information, access and print the year of one of the movies.

If you haven't done so recently, now would be a good time to check that your code works and commit once it does.
